#First line are the tokens, space-separated
#you can append "_[0-9]+" to a token to make it unique
#for specifying the dependencies. The part starting with _ won't be
#printed.

#here are the tokens - see how the second "a" is marked
#tokens: I have a dog       and a_2 cat with no tail .

# You can also specify additional token lines. These will be printed as well
# These lines must have exactly as many tokens as the first, main, token line
# if you want to skip some string, use <<NONE>> instead

#tokens: 1  2   3  <<NONE>>   5   6   7   8    9  10  11
#tokens: I have a dog       and a cat with no xxtailxx .
#Once the tokens have been specified, here go the dependencies
#
# * one dependency per line
# * left_token type right_token
# #ARC and #LAB (in this order!) specify the style for the arc and label
# see the SVG documentation: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html
